the scene opens in the motel room 104 and a man Lewes walks in and head straight to the radio to turn it on oh Christmas trees playing and he seems to like that song he walks back to the bed and sits down with his briefcase next to him and he closes his eyes the concentrate on something but a door knock interrupts a slumber Lewis then shuts off the radio and opens the door and it's Jean at the door he invites her in and she was expecting something more extravagant than a cheap motel room from the devil and is a bit disappointed that she got this and not a mansion Louis had to clarify that it's policy to engage with a client at their personal level for Jean that seemed a bit insulting Louis asked her to have a seat so they can go over the contract that she will be signing soon and she had to look foreign white to find him but he does this intentionally so the people who truly want to be here can come to make the deal so the high bar for the entriesassistant and he could just retire and do whatever it is that he wants to do like water skiing or something it's kind of a win-win for the both of them and he won't be crucified for abandoning his job and she won't have to spend the rest of Eternity in the torment of hell this kind of intrigues Lewis but he warns her that she would be directly involved in a large amount of endless suffering for thousands of human beings and he's not sure she can deal with it but Jean isn't exactly an average human being as she's basically been in training her whole life for this and she goes on with their evil branding quite comfortably he gets that she's a sociopath but for something like this she has to be a whole new level of evil that humans haven't reached before because she can't take the job and then decide she can't handle it because it's going to bounce back on Lewis's face pretty badly genius confident wants to prove herself to him so she calls out for her assistant Dustin who was waiting outside the door and he was just on the phone with the airport aboutplay jazz but she doesn't care about that now and she introduces him to Louis and things get a bit awkward and she takes her purse and poured to drink for Dustin while she tells him about the new deal she just struck with Louis Dustin is seemingly happy to help out in any way that he can and she is glad and she wants to give Dustin an opportunity to experience something millions of people have been arguing about for thousands of years like a reward for being a good assistant for all those years Dustin still has no idea what's going on but he drinks the scotch and she Direction toward the bathroom door she tells him when he opens that door he'll be absolutely stunned by what he sees on the other side but before that she tells him that she's grateful for having him and his patience she guides them toward the door and he opens it and is immediately greeted by the absolute terrible sight of Hell he's shocked at what he's seeing but without missing a beat Jean pushes him inside and locks the door behind him this seemed like an adequate Edition butmansion and she isn't just doing this to save her life now she's genuinely excited to damn people to hell as a job so Louis had to check with her supervisor first and the supervisor was surprisingly cool with it and he wants her about the Politics of hell and to watch her back but just as Louis was about to walk out there's a knock on the door and it says next appointment that he forgot but this is James first appointment and she's very excited to get started so she opened the door to let the woman in she introduces herself and Louis talks to Beth and she's a musician and is here to make sure she's the greatest rock star on the planet but when she doesn't accept the drink Jean offers genus puzzled with the concept of a non drinking musician meth is all about the music and wants nothing to do with the rest of the stuff associated with the lifestyle Louis sits her down and asks her whywhat's to do this if it's just about the music but Jinn interrupts him saying the Beth doesn't need to practice because why take the stairs when you can take the elevator but this particular elevator doesn't go up it also doesn't back down Jean tells him to leave because they've already made the deal and it's time for her to make the deal with Beth Beth tells him she's a very ambitious artist and with the music business the way it is it's almost impossible to get noticed Louis is still trying to convince her not to do it but Jean stops him because she is best are on the same page and he's the only one trying to fight this so he better just leave now he hands over the contract but before he leaves he wants to hear a song Beth asks him what song and he tells her oh Christmas tree and she starts singing beautifully and he looks at her with a peaceful look in his eye and Beth sings on and Jean and Louis look at her knowing what waits for her at the end and here we see the scene ending and the story is overgenus committed and she listens to Black Sabbath album which is a band from the UK that she likes the album changed her life but Louis has no idea who they are and she tries to explain thinking the devil would be into heavy metal but Louis isn't a fan of contemporary music she then realises that most of the good musicians must be in hell too and lose must know them so she asked if he knows any of them but sadly he can't discuss other clients she keeps going so he had to stop her and make her focus on the deal that had and Jean that sits down and tells him that everyone seems to be partying and having a great time while she gets to just not have any of that the other girls with the expensive cars amazing Apartments and her boyfriend's were all making her jealous they all have that and she wants to and she could not understand why she can't have a lot of boyfriends Drive cool cars and look amazing just like them just so she can get back athe knows what she's talking about and he can definitely help her with that and Jean gets a bit confused because he's not exactly trying to convince her to sell her soul but that it's not the way he does things and that this has to be 100% her decision so apparently this is how it works once she makes the decision and she's comfortable with it Louis will have her sign the papers and that's it so he gives her a pen and she immediately flips through the pages to find the signature line but luas stops her because she definitely should read the contract before signing it he urges her to at least take a look at the last election which mentions that Louis will gain ownership of her soul for eternity and he asks her again if she's completely comfortable with that and she seems to not care at all he was still confused about her not caring so he asks why she seemed so comfortable with giving up her soul the thing is Jean actually doesn't believe in a soul or any other religious Dogmacentered around that according to Lewis and Jean still doesn't care so he checks one last time and this would be giving up her soul for eternity and he tries to scare her by saying that she would be going to hell once her ride on earth is over but she laughs at his face and dismisses his warning as she eagerly signs the contract to have a lavish luxury filled life 50 years later in the same hotel room Louis is there again and he goes to the radio and flips through the channels but he doesn't quite like the music of today so he just turns it off and then there's a familiar knock and he opens the door and it's Jean after all these years they reunited Jean is now very old but she still has that smile on her face so far she's been really great she's lived a Life full of worldly pleasures drink sex food drugs sport cars Mansions she's had it all needless to say she's been enjoyingdrink but it has to be a quick one because she has a private jet waiting for her at the airport to take her to St bars she won't be making her flight this time and Louis is there to collect on his deal in this is her day of reckoning per her agreement his company now owns her soul and he's just here to get what's rightfully his she won't be going to say in parts the night and she has another destination which is hell for eternity Jean even after all these years is still not convinced that this is a serious matter she wants her lawyer to look at it but Louis showed her everything before she signed it all those years ago but according to her no one reads the terms and conditions but it feels like signing away your soul would require some reading she was trying to dismiss this but they kept their side of the deal and now it's time to keep hers she's had 50 long years and now it's time toit up for all those pleasure for an amazing years that she spent on earth Jean arrogantly says no in this really pisses him off and he has to go through this every time as people have to argue with him instead of actually reading the contracts that they sign she then asks what he means when he says he'll but to Lewis that's the obvious part the one everyone sees in the movies and paintings and she asks if it's one of those ironic hell's like Homer Simpson and the doughnuts but there's really no irony here and she's going to be stepping into a never-ending torment and endless Hellfire and brimstone and there's really no escaping that Jesus still not convinced that hell is an actual thing the way to depicted in art and media so she starts mocking hell in heaven Louis hasn't been to Heaven but it's pretty much the idea that it's a better place than hell when she still doesn't buy it Louis has no other choice but to show her preview and they walk over to the bathroomloud and torturous burning misery of hell this scares her so much that she had to throw up in the trash can and she finally realises that she has to go spend an eternity in there and it would have been nice to tell her that she'll get used to it but that's never really the case to her this might look harsh or unfair but everyone in hell is there because they deserve it where they made a deal with the devil like Jean but Jean was not letting this happen so she calls her lawyer Lewis was fed up with this so he takes her phone and he seen thousands of Lawyers reading these contracts and thousands of languages and it always goes the same way because there's really no loophole as she's indefinitely sold her soul and she's going to hell forever the room becomes bleak as Jean Louis sit down on the bed and he tries to comfort her tell her that she's had 50 great years and some people don't even have 50 great minutes he seems sad withit's kind of depressing to send all these people to an endless torment and Damnation every day as it's kind of a real bummer for him Louis was kind of pissed that humans get all excited and literally sign up their lives for this but when it's time to pay the regret it and dive into a life that's even worse than the one day escape but Jean didn't have any regrets that it took her a while to get used to it but once she did she couldn't be stopped being a sadistic evil person really suits her and there was a Turning Point where things became clear to her and she was dating this man and playing with his emotions and then she realised that she had a choice she could be sympathetic or she could just let go and not care about anything and she chose the second option and turned off her compassion so she went out with the guy until she got bored and then tossed him away but that was just the Beginning as she did some terrible things after thatand she thought of all people Louis would enjoy these stories with him being the Devil at all but it turns out that Lewis is not actually the devil and he just works for him and when she tries to insinuate if he's a demon or not he gets really upset because he's more of an executive assistant to the devil Jean thinks that that's so cool thing and it was cool at first but after a few thousand years Louis is just plain tired of it all and he thought he was cut out for this kind of life but he has horrible nightmares every night and he couldn't handle this business anymore and he isn't sure how much longer he can deal with it Jean didn't tell him to stop if he doesn't like doing it anymore and just say no that the devil but if he does that what Jean will experience as a walk in the park compared to what the devil will do to Louis if he tells him no but Jean was not giving up as she thinks there is a way for the both of them to get out of their little predicament here and she suggests taking over his job and she could become the
