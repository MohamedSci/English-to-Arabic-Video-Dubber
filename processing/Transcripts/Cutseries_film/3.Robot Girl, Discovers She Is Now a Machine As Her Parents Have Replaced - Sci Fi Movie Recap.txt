and the movie starts with a gold necklace falling on thick snow there's a woman hanging on a ledge of a snowy cliff and she doesn't look like she'll be able to pull herself up and she screams as the screen fades to Black a little girl in a red Jacket is running across a forest she looks nervous and scared but before long she reaches a house and she looks around as she head's for the door as she knocks on it Alex opens it and a surprised to find Ava at his door he asked her what she's doing there and where her mom is but the little girl faints before answering next we see that it's the year 2041 and a plane makes its way across the snowy mountains to a small airfield where David was there waiting with his car for Alex to get off the plane David is happy to see Alex and Alex gets off the plane holding a small travel bag along with his robot cat following him they hug tightly as they haven't seen each other in 10 years and they're both too cold andhad enough and says the phrase what do

stands over him and tells him to go away after cleaning up he gets a hug from Max and that morning he goes to Julia and tells her that he won't be able to finish the project and Julia asked if it's because of Lana but he leaves without answering Alex then goes over to see Ava and he tells her that he will be leaving soon and she's clearlyupset by the news and she asked him not to leave because she just got to meet him and it's clear that there's some kind of special connection between them in his workshop Lana Comes by to visit and apologises but as soon as she climbs down the stairs they Kiss Again and Lana says that she wants to tell him something important when all of this was going on Ava was looking through the window and she heard Lana tell Alex that they made Ava and also said something else that Ava couldn't make out Ava makes a noise from the place that she was at and Lana runs after her saying that it has to be her to tell Ava the truth she finds Eva passed out on the snow and she cuts out the skin of her back and reveals a metal casing Ava was apparently robot a lot of quickly changes something and Ava wakes up again and when Lana try to explain to Ava about what she really is Ava wouldn't listen and pushed her away and Lana tried to hug her which broke the gold necklace Ava push onethis is when she ran toward Alex's house at the opening scene and Alex carries Eva inside till she wakes up and he calls David to tell him about Ava but he hears that Lana's inside the hospital and when hearing this he takes Ava with him and they rush over there but unfortunately Lana died there in the hospital and Max laid down a tired Ava and Alex talks to Julia and she tells him that Ava was the first as i9 that he worked on originally and Lana kept her despite having safety issues and at this point they had no other choice but to dispose of Ava so Alex volunteers do it he took her ice skating one last time and after they took a walk through the snow she showed him a few asked him to fix her but there was nothing he could do at home he takes her to bed and once he puts her down he whispers those words what do you see when you close your eyes shutting her down one last time and the movie ends as we see a sequence of Adamto leave quickly in the car they talk about the amazing robots Alex is made and how David prefers lecturing because he likes the students David invites Alex to stay with his family but Alex wants to stay at his parents house which they both think would be a mess at the university students were working on a lot of robots even outside and as Alex was getting out David invite him to dinner which he accepts he walks into the university and makes his way to Julia's office but his greeted by a receptionist bought who tells him that Julius teaching a class and is unavailable at that moment he doesn't listen and just walks in anyways and as soon as he walks in the students recognise who he is and Julia greet him two students seem to be having trouble with their small robot horse and Alex makes his way over to them and inspect the situation and he asked them what they should do next and won student says what you see when you close your eyes which is a phrase that shuts down any robot forcefully Alex doesn't like that and explainsmemory Julia also tells the rest of the class that the phrase is Sacred and it should only be used in the Most Extreme cases Julia walks Alex over to a window and when he looks inside he sees the robot that looks exactly like a real boy the SI 9 has everything made just like the way Alex designed it 10 years ago and it's only missing one thing the emotional intelligence software Alex is there to figure out and install the software which is something Julia had deemed impossible years ago they walk in and Alex inspects the robot structure closely and this is when Julia asks him to complete the project that he started all those years ago because he's the only one who can make this robot both fun and safe Alex walks over to Julius car and as he was about to step in he sees her Lana his former lover he seems shaken in surprised to see her teaching a group of studentsshe also stops for a second when she sees it's actually him but he gets inside the car and they drive off they go to the house and he scans his palm to open the door they can see the house is quite dirty inside and still has old pictures of Alex and his family he tells her that he wants to set up in the basement and she tells him that she will ship the needed components over to him the next morning Alex had fallen asleep while working and was woken up by a knock at the door he opens it and his meant by si 7 and Android named Max and Max analyses the house and comes up with all the things that need to be cleaned up and done when Alex asks Max he finds out the Max is made by David his brother and the Max is more like a personal assistant he leaves Max to do the cleaning and heads over to the university and Alex and Julia were looking at videos of different boys performing tasks but Alex doesn't really like them cuz to him they all seem to boring to base the character of the new model on as he washow to work out of the building he sees the Lana was lecturing and he decides to drop by the class ends just as he sits down and after the students leave she tells him that the students are learning about his theories but he insists that they're there to see her instead but they both couldn't stop smiling as Alex was driving back home he sees a group of girls playing and one of them catches his eye it was Ava and her red jacket and she confronts him and asked him why he's looking at the children so much and he answers her but he was surprised she was a very confident dashing child all the things that Alex had been looking for then she blatantly accuses him of being a pervert who likes to look at kids and this sold it for Alex as this was just a type of non boring kid that he'd been searching for when he offers her candy she drives home her point that he's a pervert but she takes the candy anyways he then tells her about his work and invites her to work together he walks into the house and sees Maxprepare dinner and made a basket for the cat Max and the cat could really get along because the cat is a free robot and isn't governed by the same rules as Max after eating Alex gets to work trying to come up with a suitable software for the new model when he's happy with the design he sends it to a prototype robot and the robot wakes up and starts doing things and Alex records the weights behaving a phone call comes in and it scares the robot and it was David who invite Alex to dinner and to hang out before he could say no that night he gets to David's house and they talk about Max in the house Lana walks in and it's clear that Lana and David are married but then something happens that surprises Alex Ave walks in the door and David tells her to introduce herself to uncle Alex she does and winks at him not telling them that she met Alex before all four of them gather around the dinner table and talk about Alex and his work he then takes a video of them as they were playing together MaxAlex that the girl would be a bit out of the ordinary to be a model for the robot but Alex tells him that this was what he was looking for but in the video Alex was more focused on Lana than Ava Alex falls asleep working again and is woken up by the sound of rocks being thrown at his window and it was Eva and he walks out of his house and greet her and she leaves off the roof of the car that she was sitting on and walks inside the house she plays around with the different gadgets in the workshop and when he finish his setting up the computer Alex let's her tell him the emotions that she sees on the different images on the screen she then gets bored and leaves but he doesn't follow her so she comes back she insists on seeing the brain Alex is working on so he shows it to her and all the components and how it works and he then starts it and she sees the prototype robot wake up Ava was at home now taking a bath and Lana was washing her hair Ava tells her that she was with Alex that day and Lana was upset and warnshow to ride her bike out of town like that again Ava's bold and ask the type of relationship that Alex and Lana had and Lana does her best to explain but she ends up playing it off with a joke Alex was at the university trying to convince Julia to base the model on a girl instead of a boy because he thinks girls are more interesting and are a lot more fun than boys that age he walks out and finds Lana and they both walk over to the parking lot and as they were talking it's obvious that they're still tension between them and unresolved feelings David was there to pick her up and she leaves and in the morning Ava was that Alex's house again but he tells her to leave because her parents don't want her to be working on the project but she convinces him to stay and they go ice skating which Alex is not really good at so Ava shows him some moves they climb a mountain together and they can see the city and she shows him her house and across the town she shows him another house and tells him that David lives therewhen Alex was looking through the footage that he recorded with Ava the prototype robot ask them if Ave was his daughter because she looks a lot like him and this makes Alex think because he left Lana in the university around the same time we're Ave would have been conceived the next day Alex was outside of their house looking through the fence as Lana and Ava played in the snow and when he got startled by David who was coming home David invites Alex inside but Alex comes up with an excuse and refuses to go inside that night Alex was working on his prototype and as he was going through the images it said something made Alex laugh but when he laughed the robot got offended and went into rage throwing paper on the floor Alex tries to command it to stop but the robot would listen and asked Alex opened the door because it wanted to leave and when Alex says no the robot throws a wood Carver at his
