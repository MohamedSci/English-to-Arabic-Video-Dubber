simulated war environment Walter takes the lead in order to squad to attack from the front but Thomas argues they should flank them and force them the surrender Walter refuses to listen to Thomas's idea in orders his team to follow his plan but Thomas ignores his orders and runs to the field on his own which doesn't go well as he gets shot by the enemy team immediately and the squad loses another exercise April the squad leader yells at them for not being coordinated and for losing again captain black thing comes over to in schools the team for their horrible performance throughout the training program he tells them if they don't improve soon they will all be rejected from the force everyone is mad at Thomas for screwing the lastcycle on the leg chieftain tells the squad to get into

they drive through the wood Tyler and the chief just managed to take out most of the aliens with their superior rain but when they taught they were safe and alien jump in front of the car and crashes it with the car no longer working chief tells the squad to go the extraction point as he holds off the aliens he then puts his last bandage on Michael's like stopping is bleeding but Tyler then reveals she has been shot on the chief tells them to get to the pelican now in order to not stop running until they get their the squad didn't start running to the pelican but shallots condition was too much for her to continue and they stop in the middle they lie her in the ground and try and give her painkillers but she takes off her tag and gives it to Thomas she then tells him she is sorry and takes her last breath chief joins them shortly after and tells them another one is coming they then start running topelican but they get cut off by a giant alien thomaston tells chief he will be a decoy and runs to another direction the alien then starts shooting at Thomas but as it is distracted chief jumps on his back and detonates a bomb killing the alien Thomas is luckily survived and they all managed to make it to the pelican they get picked up by elite soldiers and they see the destroyed in burning Earth this they leave it chief commenced Thomas's bravery and gives him a black rock he took from the Remains of the giant alien the moving cuts decades after and we see an older Thomas still holding childish tag with the black rock he then gets into a cryopod is humanity's Last Hope get ready for war theand he tries to defend himself by saying the command was stupid but they all tell him to just follow the orders Thomas even gets into an argument with his closest friend chyler as he believes the war in general doesn't make sense and tells her the Insurrection is start just over tax farmers but she tells him they are terrorists that killed a lot of innocent people Thomas is then called into colonel Murphy's office for disobeying orders she tells him she doesn't want him to be disqualified from the forest because she sees how good of a soldier he can become and she reminds him that his mother is expecting him to become a highly decorated soldier just as his brother later that night we find Thomas watching it recording of his brother in his room his brother used to leave him recordings every day he was at the field and updated him about the war they also played chess every day which Thomas won every time showing us how good of a strategist he is as Thomas goes to bed he knocks on his wall and waits for Tyler who was in the next room did not back this is a way for them to say goodbye to each other and even though they ended the day with the fight trailer alsotop secret military recording demo watches him in Warrington did not at the recordings as it will definitely get him disqualified but Michael is very into it and he continues to recover the classified files Thomas continues to watch his brother's recordings but he is interrupted by Tyler and they make up but they still argue on the need for war against the insurrectionists in the middle of the night a drill alarm wakes up Thomas and the squad this means they need to be geared and ready very fast April waits for them at the station but they take a longer time because Walter and Thomas held up everyone because they were arguing over who unlocks the door this makes them late enough for one of them to not be fully geared and they fail another test again captain black thing comes in and informs them that tomorrow they will be having a final test which they will have to pass otherwise they will be disqualified from the Academy Michael continues to work on recovering the classified videos he starts discovering weird things in thehigh ranking colonel in the army the next morning we see everyone sat at the breakfast table April is mad at Walter and Thomas for their behaviour last night so she orders them to give her the food they comply and give her their food but as they walk back while they're Tom's Thomas by bringing up his brother's death which makes Thomas very angry and he takes him to the ground and punches him the two get into a fist fight until it is stopped by colonel mattify and she calls Thomas in for starting the fight Thomas thinks he's going to get punished but Matt a few was actually impressed with him and tells him he needs to unlock his inner strength she then dismisses him with no punishment later the squad learns about the second punic war they are taught that even though the Roman Republic had 10,000 more soldiers than hannibal's he used their pride in hubris against them and won the War by sacrificing his front army and using them as a distraction while he flank from the back and decimate the Roman armyfind cinder estimated him and walked right into a trap which is a lesson for the squad to never underestimate their enemy and what they will sacrifice to win after the class Thomas and Tyler talk about what they learnt Thomas is clearly not impressed with the lesson but Tyler advises him if he really wants people to change and to stop the war then he should become a leader that people listen to the next morning the squad Meetup for their final test of the term April gives the motivation and before she sends them to the arena Thomas asked her to be the squad leader this time she pauses for a moment but then gives him the command and tells him he better lead his team to Victory the exercise is capturing the flag Thomas's team gather at their flag and wait for his command Thomas then sees the way the other team is gathering and Orders his team to just sit a few minutes pass by and everyone is bored to just sit on one spot and not engage Thomas plan is working though as he sees the other team moving into their position he then orders his team to take her their helmet which is what they used to track the other teamwhen is confused by his order but they follow it the other team then move into their area following their tracker but when they get there they only find helmets and Thomas's demand bushes them from behind and takes out all of them Thomas then goes to grab the enemies flag but he Falls unconscious before getting there you wakes up in the medical center and the doctor tells him Thomas has been having an allergic reaction to the cryo injection he then tells him to rest until he finds out how much of a problem is allergy is Thomas leaps for the rest of the day and wakes up while watching his brother's recordings she asks him why torments himself out watching these old videos she then tells him his team won for the first time because of his leadership and ideas they then get a voice call from Michael who tells them to come to his room immediately all the squad gathers in his room and he finally shows them the recovered classified videos in the video they see the Marines and the Insurrection is helping each other and running from something else this is confusing to everyone as the two groups should hate each other they then see all of them running and they see a reflection of the thing from the Elite Fourtell me about the image is not clear enough to see what exactly it is their running from before they can continue digging they all call to the cafeteria for dinner and while everyone guesses what the enemy might be Thomas is called into colonel's manifest office she tells him his medical results have came back and it shows that Thomas's allergy to the cryo injection is high enough for a medical discharge she then gives him the release form and tells him and his his choice to decide whether he wants to stay or leave she tells him if he decides to leave you will be discharged tomorrow and encourages him to remember what he is willing to Sacrifice Thomas comes back to his room and sure of what to do you watches the recording of his mother telling him his brother's death he is then interrupted by Michael who tells him he needs to show him something important Michael has cleared the image on the helmets reflection but as he tries to zoom in the image the computer deletes the image fully Michael freaks out thinking he has been found out by the authorities and he runs away searching for demo to ask her if she actually told her mother about his illegal activThomas goes outside for a walk and finds Tyler sitting on a container he tells her about his allergy she asks him if he is leaving but he tells her he hasn't decided yet she then tells
